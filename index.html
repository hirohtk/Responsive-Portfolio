                Born in Hawaii, Kensen moved to the greater Seattle area in 2008 to attend UW Seattle for undergraduate studies.  While there, he became acclimated to a diverse group of friends that he would not have otherwise met while still living in Hawaii.  These friends were from all across the globe, including India, Korea, Singapore, and Japan.  Of course, he would meet local Washingtonians who he still keeps in touch with today.  
                <br>
                <br>
                Academically, Kensen obtained a BS Degree in Biochemistry from the UW.  Currently a sales engineer for lab scale tangential flow membrane research equipment, he enjoys consulting with customers to explore best fits for their needs.

                Most recently, he has developed an interest in web design/development in hopes of being able to create webpages and web apps which are currently lacking in his industry, so that better resources can be used to help others that follow similar lines of work.  He is currently developing ideas for final project(s) that can be marketed and one day produce personal revenue.
                <br><br>
                His non-professional interests include playing badminton, bike riding, listening to the latest in the EDM genres of trance, drum and bass, and bass music.
